# ZipToPdfConverter

## What does it do?

It adds a Context Menu to your File Explorer so that when you right click on Zip Files, you can automatically convert the Zip to a Zip but it has the Pdfs in it. Smart right?

## Why tf?

Imagine you have a teacher that always uploads their Documents as a Zip that includes PowerPoint and Word Files, but you need them as Pdfs.

Well then this Project is exactly for you (yes im lookin at you (you know you're looked at if you know))

## Who to use?

### Requirements
You need to have the Word and PowerPoint Interop assembly.

### Installation

3. Paste it into the [install_zip_to_pdf.reg](./install_zip_to_pdf.reg) file
4. Execute that file
5. Hope it works, im pressing my thumbs for you haha
